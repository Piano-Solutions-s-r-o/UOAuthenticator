# The command-scoped assignment is the trust boundary: Prisma may migrate with
# the admin principal, but this shell's DATABASE_URL remains the runtime DSN.
#
# `set -eu` would abort here on any migrate failure, and for MOST failures that
# is right: refusing to serve on an unknown schema beats serving on one. P3009 is
# different. It means a PREVIOUS migration died half-applied and left
# `_prisma_migrations` with `finished_at NULL, rolled_back_at NULL`; the schema
# itself rolled back, but the bookkeeping is wedged and EVERY subsequent boot
# fails the same way. A bare non-zero exit turns that into an unexplained
# crash-loop and a total auth outage until somebody thinks to read the container
# log. So catch it and say exactly what to run.
#
# Captured to a file rather than piped through `tee`: in POSIX sh a pipeline
# reports the LAST command's status, so `prisma ... | tee log` would report
# tee's success and swallow every migration failure. `pipefail` is not POSIX
# (dash does not have it), so the status is taken directly.
